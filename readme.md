Polytope provides a REST API for access to hypercube data, stored in various data sources (FDBs, MARS, etc.). Polytope is comprised of a number of microservices:

* **frontend**: REST API running Falcon/Flask
* **worker**: responsible for fetching data and pushing it to a staging area for download
* **broker**: responsible for scheduling pending requests
* **garbage-collector**: responsible for cleaning up old requests and freeing up space in the staging area

Through common abstraction layers, these components speak to various other services:

* **request_store**: database to track requests (MongoDB)
* **queue**: queue to dispatch requests to workers (RabbitMQ)
* **staging**: object-store to serve and receive data (S3, BasicHTTPServer)
* **authentication**: for authenticating users to Polytope (ECMWF API, Basic MongoDB, API Key MongoDB)
* **authorization**: for managing authorization to different collections (ECMWF LDAP, MongoDB)
* **identity**: for registering users with Polytope (MongoDB)
* **api-keys**: for generating Polytope API keys (MongoDB)
* **caching**: caching of web requests to various services (MongoDB, Redis, Memcached)

## Quick Start

```bash
cd polytope-deployment
export SKAFFOLD_IMAGE_REGISTRY=localhost:32000
skaffold dev
```

## Testing

Unit tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit
```

Generic integration tests (a deployment is required):
